# ChessMaster - A React Chess Game
Chessmaster is a 2-player chess game that works using Rails' Action Cable. The game logic is vanilla Javascript, while the board, pieces, and the rest of the user interface are React components.

### Action Cable
This React Chess Game uses a Rails API to run & serve moves via websocket. You can find that socket [here](http://https://github.com/jrgreiner115/react-chess-api "here").

Further plans include completing the web socket configuration to allow for multiple users & games to occur at the same time.
